## 👋 Hi, I’m Nick Caceres, aspiring software dev, University of Southern California Biology & Loyola High School grad, programming & foreign language enthusiast! 🇺🇸🇵🇪🇲🇽🇨🇳🇮🇹🇫🇷🇰🇷
![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=java,kotlin,js,ts,swift,py,ruby,php) ***- Just a few of my skills!***
- 💥 I’d love to learn everything the wonderful world of software development has to offer! Here's what I've focused on lately!
    - SwiftCharts + Android Jetpack Compose
    - Including AWS in my portfolio while I transition away from Heroku and onboard to Railway!
    - Svelte (possibly SvelteKit 1.0) as well as adding a scheduler to its Flask backend to update the game database (and therefore the UI when you see it!)
    - Swapping out Jest for Vite in my Laravel Accounting on It project, so compiling can be quicker and testing can be so much simpler!
- But overall I've been learning quite a bit about PHP using the framework that thought of everything, Laravel, alongside Vue.js, all the while I improve my Ruby skills thanks to the [Ruby Style Guide](https://rubystyle.guide) as well as my use of React Hooks [by making my own](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html). In the mobile dev world, I've been continuing along my journey as an iOS and Android dev and trying to roll along with all the   interesting changes that Apple and Google have been putting out there. There seemingly is a good-sized update every time I go back to one of my mobile projects! Never a dull moment for sure. Though, if I do happen to feel a lull in the fun coming on, it's always entertaining to be able to make my own simple tools and scripts with python 🐍, or even just read a few articles on an upcoming language or framework that I haven't yet learned like Go and Gin
- ✌️ I’d be happy to collaborate on my 'Account on It' project, my 'Infection Prevention' projects, or any fun and wild projects that fellow software devs would like to throw my way. On the other hand, I definitely have had my eyes on a few interesting projects on Github that could use some sprucing up 🌱, notably Railway and its documentation. After doing my research, its underlying Nixpacks engine makes for a smooth experience, but takes quite a bit of work on the developers' part to understand at the moment. Hopefully I can share some of the learning I did to help others learn too! To be an awesome software dev, you have to be up for a challenge right? I'd be plenty proud to contribute in any way that I can to the latest and greatest projects out there, overcoming any challenges on the way as a team.
- 📫 As for how to reach me, it would be best to check out [my portfolio site](https://caceres-portfolio.up.railway.app/) for a 'contact me page.' I should have one soon! Thanks!
