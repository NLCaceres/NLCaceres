## 👋 Hi, I’m Nick Caceres, aspiring software dev, University of Southern California Biology & Loyola High School graduate, programming <img alt="java" height="25" width="25" src="https://cdn.freelogovectors.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/java-programming-language-logo.png"/> <img alt="javascript" height="25" width="25" src="https://iconape.com/wp-content/png_logo_vector/javascript-logo.png"/> <img alt="typescript" height="25" width="25" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Typescript_logo_2020.svg/240px-Typescript_logo_2020.svg.png"/> <img alt="kotlin" height="25" width="25" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Kotlin_Icon.svg/240px-Kotlin_Icon.svg.png"/> <img alt="swift" height="25" width="25" src="https://developer.apple.com/swift/images/swift-logo.svg"/> 🐍 <img alt="swift" height="25" width="25" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Ruby_logo.svg/198px-Ruby_logo.svg.png"/> <img alt="swift" height="25" width="25" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/PHP-logo.svg/320px-PHP-logo.svg.png"/> & foreign language enthusiast! 🇺🇸🇵🇪🇲🇽🇨🇳🇮🇹🇫🇷
- 💥 I’d love to learn everything the wonderful world of software development has to offer me! 
- 🌱 But lately I've been learning quite a bit about PHP using the framework that thought of everything, Laravel, alongside Vue.js, at least as far as web               development is concerned. In the mobile dev world, I've been continuing along my journey as an iOS and Android dev and trying to roll along with all the             interesting changes that Apple and Google have been putting out there. There seemingly is a good-sized update every time I go back to one of my mobile projects!     Never a dull moment for sure. Though, if I do happen to feel a lull in the fun coming on, it's always entertaining to be able to make my own simple tools and       scripts with python 🐍, or even just read a few articles on an upcoming language or framework that I haven't yet learned like Go or Svelte!
- ✌️ I’d be happy to collaborate on my 'Account on It' project, my 'Infection Prevention' projects, or any fun and wild projects that fellow rookie software devs
    would like to throw my way. On the other hand, I definitely have had my eyes on a few interesting projects on Github that could use some love and sprucing up.       Looking at you, speedskater/babel-plugin-rewire; I'd love to make Typescript work properly with you 🙏. Meanwhile theKashey/rewiremock is incredibly promising       but it could definitely afford to have better docs at the very least. To be an awesome software dev, you have to be up for a challenge right? I'd
    be plenty proud to contribute in any way that I can to the latest and greatest projects out there, overcoming any challenges on the way as a team.
- 📫 As for how to reach me, it would be best to check out [my portfolio site](https://caceres-portfolio.herokuapp.com) for a 'contact me page.' I should have one soon! Thanks!
