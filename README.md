- 💥 I’d love to learn everything the wonderful world of software development has to offer!
    - Here's some of what I've worked on lately!
        - Android Jetpack Compose for my Infection Control Employee Profile View
        - Serving up lazy-loaded AWS S3 images delivered from AWS Cloudfront on my Railway-hosted Portfolio website!
        - Optimizing Svelte routing and networking for the front-end of my MLB Promotions Calendar website
        - Setting up cron jobs via APScheduler to keep the Flask backend of the MLB Promotions Calendar website up to date as games and promotions change over the week
    - AND here's some of what I've been learning too!
        - Setting up a Contact Me Page through Ruby on Rails and a SMTP service like Mailtrap
        - SwiftCharts for even more elegant SwiftUI Layouts in iOS
        - Swapping out Jest for Vite in my Laravel Accounting on It project, so compiling can be quicker and testing can be so much simpler!
    - In the web world, I've been learning quite a bit about PHP using the framework that thought of everything, Laravel, alongside Vue.js, all while I also improve my Ruby skills thanks to the [Ruby Style Guide](https://rubystyle.guide) as
      well as my React toolbelt by trying my hand at [making my own Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html).
    - In the mobile dev world, I've been continuing along my journey as an iOS and Android dev and trying to roll along with all the interesting changes that Apple and Google have been putting out there. There seemingly is a good-sized update
      every time I go back to one of my mobile projects! Never a dull moment for sure.
    - In my spare time, I've enjoyed making simple tool and scripts with Python 🐍 to organize my files or track my expenses as well as just taking time to read articles on future languages or frameworks I should consider like Go and Gin.

- ✌️ I’d be happy to collaborate on my 'Account on It' project, my 'Infection Prevention' projects, or any fun and wild projects that fellow software devs would like to throw my way. Hopefully I can share some of the learning I did to help others learn too! To be an awesome software dev, you have to be up for a challenge right? I'd be plenty proud to contribute in any way that I can to the latest and greatest projects out there, overcoming any challenges on the way as a team.

- 📫 To reach me, it would be best to check out [my portfolio site](https://caceres-portfolio.up.railway.app/) for a 'contact me page.' I should have one soon! Thanks!
